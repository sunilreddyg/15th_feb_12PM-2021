Loops:-->
		Looping is a programming feature, Which repeatedly evaluate
		set of programs or instruction[Statements].
		
		1.For-loop
		2.For-each
		3.While
		4.Do-while
		
		Advantages:-->
				=> Reduce lines of code..
				=> Easy to perform repeated tasks.
		
		
1.For-loop:-->
		=> programer follow for loop, whenever need to iterate
			any perticular condition to evaluate expected number 
			of times.
			
		=> During for loop programmer should define start-iteration
				and end-iteration value.
				
				
		Syntax:-->
				
				for(Variable initiation ;  Condition  ; increment/decrement)
				{
					 //Set of programms to evaluate repeatedly should write
					 //under curved braces.
				}
				
				
		Example:--> [Print numbers 1 to 10]
			
				for(int i=1,  i<=10, i++)
				{
					systems.out.println(i);
				}		
				
				
				=> For-loop accept initiation of variable only numerics.
				=> For-loop accept iteration when condition return true,
						And it follow iteration until condition return false.
				=> We can also eject looping by writing  break;  keyword.
===============================================================================>		
Foreach:-->
			Foreach loop usefull to iterate Array next values.
			It is desinged to read array and collection values..
			
			
			for(Variable : Arrayname)
			{
				//Iteate based on array size.
			}
			
=====================================================================
while:-->
	=> While is a condition based loop.
	=> While accept loop when condition return true
			and continue iteration until condition return false.
	=> During while loop we should provide icrement/decrement
			or Any condition to break loop othewise it get into
			infinity loop.


		Syntax:--> 
				while(condition)
		 		{
		 
				}
			
		=> While accept only boolean value.	
			
====================================================================
Do-While:-->
		Do while work similar as While loop,But only diff do-while
		accept iteration once even condition return false.
		
		
		do
		{
		
		}while(condition);
